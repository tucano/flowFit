title = {New approaches to fluorescence compensation and visualization of FACS data},
abstract = {The Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) is an invaluable tool for clinicians and researchers alike in phenotyping and sorting individual cells. With the advances in FACS methodology, notably intracellular staining for cytokines, transcription factors and phosphoproteins, and with increases in the number of fluorescence detection channels, researchers now have the opportunity to study individual cells in far greater detail than previously possible. In this chapter, we discuss High-Definition (Hi-D) FACS methods that can improve analysis of lymphocyte subsets in mouse and man. We focus on the reasons why fluorescence compensation, which is necessary to correct for spectral overlap between two or more fluorochromes used in the same staining combination, is best done as a computed transformation rather than using the analog circuitry available on many flow cytometers. In addition, we introduce a new data visualization method that scales the axes on histograms and two-dimensional contour (or dot) plots to enable visualization of signals from all cells, including those that have minimal fluorescence values and are not properly represented with traditional logarithmic axes. This "Logicle" visualization method, we show, provides superior representations of compensated data and makes correctly compensated data look correct. Finally, we discuss controls that facilitate recognition of boundaries between positive and negative subsets.},

title = {Use of cell-tracking dyes to determine proliferation precursor frequencies of antigen-specific T cells},
abstract = {The T-cell receptor provides T cells with specificity for antigens of particular molecular structure (the "epitope"); the T-cell pool in an individual responds to the presence of many different antigenic epitopes, but any particular T cell will respond preferentially to one defined epitope. After stimulation of a T cell by the binding of its receptor to its cognate antigen in the context of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule on an antigen-presenting cell, the T cell will begin to proliferate and synthesize cytokines. Tetramer binding and the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) method have been used to determine what proportion of cells in the T-cell pool can bind to a defined antigenic peptide or will secrete cytokines in response to a particular antigenic stimulation. The method described here uses tracking dyes to determine what proportion of T cells will proliferate in response to stimulation. As a flow cytometric "single-cell" method, it can be combined with tetramer and cytokine staining to determine the precursor frequencies of cells in the T-cell pool able to bind tetramer, to synthesize cytokines, and to proliferate in response to antigen.},

title = {Purification of specific cell population by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)},
abstract = {Experimental and clinical studies often require highly purified cell populations. FACS is a technique of choice to purify cell populations of known phenotype. Other bulk methods of purification include panning, complement depletion and magnetic bead separation. However, FACS has several advantages over other available methods. FACS is the preferred method when very high purity of the desired population is required, when the target cell population expresses a very low level of the identifying marker or when cell populations require separation based on differential marker density. In addition, FACS is the only available purification technique to isolate cells based on internal staining or intracellular protein expression, such as a genetically modified fluorescent protein marker. FACS allows the purification of individual cells based on size, granularity and fluorescence. In order to purify cells of interest, they are first stained with fluorescently-tagged monoclonal antibodies (mAb), which recognize specific surface markers on the desired cell population (1). Negative selection of unstained cells is also possible. FACS purification requires a flow cytometer with sorting capacity and the appropriate software. For FACS, cells in suspension are passed as a stream in droplets with each containing a single cell in front of a laser. The fluorescence detection system detects cells of interest based on predetermined fluorescent parameters of the cells. The instrument applies a charge to the droplet containing a cell of interest and an electrostatic deflection system facilitates collection of the charged droplets into appropriate collection tubes (2). The success of staining and thereby sorting depends largely on the selection of the identifying markers and the choice of mAb. Sorting parameters can be adjusted depending on the requirement of purity and yield. Although FACS requires specialized equipment and personnel training, it is the method of choice for isolation of highly purified cell populations.},

abstract = {Flow cytometry is one of the fundamental research tools available to the life scientist. The ability to observe multidimensional changes in protein expression and activity at single-cell resolution for a large number of cells provides a unique perspective on the behavior of cell populations. However, the analysis of complex multidimensional data is one of the obstacles for wider use of polychromatic flow cytometry. Recent enhancements to an open-source platform-R/Bioconductor-enable the graphical and data analysis of flow cytometry data. Prior examples have focused on high-throughput applications. To facilitate wider use of this platform for flow cytometry, the analysis of a dataset, obtained following isolation of CD4(+)CD62L(+) T cells from Balb/c splenocytes using magnetic microbeads, is presented as a form of tutorial. A common workflow for analyzing flow cytometry data was presented using R/Bioconductor. In addition, density function estimation and principal component analysis are provided as examples of more complex analyses. The compendium presented here is intended to help illuminate a path for inquisitive readers to explore their own data using R/Bioconductor (available as Supporting Information).},

title = {High resolution cell lineage tracing reveals developmental variability in leech},
abstract = {Knowing the normal patterns of embryonic cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation is a cornerstone for understanding development. Yet for most species, the precision with which embryonic cell lineages can be determined is limited by technical considerations (the large numbers of cells, extended developmental times, opacity of the embryos), and these are exacerbated by the inherent variability of the lineages themselves. Here, we present an improved method of cell lineage tracing in the leech Helobdella, driving the expression of a nuclearly localized histone H2B:GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein in selected lineages by microinjection of a plasmid vector. This construct generates a long lasting and minimally mosaic signal with single cell resolution, and does not disrupt the development of most lineages tested. We have validated this technique by elucidating details of cell lineages contributing to segmental and prostomial tissues that could not be observed with standard dextran lineage tracers.},

title = {Analysis of histone 2B-GFP retention reveals slowly cycling hematopoietic stem cells},
abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are thought to divide infrequently based on their resistance to cytotoxic injury targeted at rapidly cycling cells and have been presumed to retain labels such as the thymidine analog 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). However, BrdU retention is neither a sensitive nor specific marker for HSCs. Here we show that transient, transgenic expression of a histone 2B (H2B)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein in mice has several advantages for label-retention studies over BrdU, including rapid induction of H2B-GFP in virtually all HSCs, higher labeling intensity and the ability to prospectively study label-retaining cells, which together permit a more precise analysis of division history. Mathematical modeling of H2B-GFP dilution in HSCs, identified with a stringent marker combination (L(-)K(+)S(+)CD48(-)CD150(+)), revealed unexpected heterogeneity in their proliferation rates and showed that approximately 20% of HSCs divide at an extremely low rate (< or =0.8-1.8% per day).},

title = {Characterization and efficacy of PKH26 as a probe to study the replication history of the human hematopoietic KG1a progenitor cell line},
abstract = {The PKH26 dye can, in principle, be used for the study of asymmetric cell divisions (ASDs). A requirement for the identification of ASDs based on fluorescence intensity is that the PKH26 dye is distributed equally between daughter cells at each division, but this has not been demonstrated at a single-cell level. The efficacy of PKH26 as a probe for the study of ASDs was examined using the human hematopoietic KG1a cell. An automated time-lapse fluorescent microscope system was used to determine changes in cell size and fluorescence intensity during culture, and track cell divisions. The images of daughter cells were analyzed using the Isee software to determine the distribution of PKH26 dye between daughter cells. Ratios of cell size, mean fluorescence intensity, and total fluorescence intensity were calculated by dividing the values for one daughter cell by the value of the other daughter cell. The ratios for cell size, mean intensity, and total intensity were 1.13 +/- 0.12, 1.08 +/- 0.07, and 1.15 +/- 0.14 (mean +/- SD), respectively. Thus, PKH26 is not distributed equally to both daughter cells upon cell division. However, the replication history of individual KG1a cells can be reliably deduced for up to three divisions based solely on the mean and total fluorescence intensity of the PKH26 dye, using PKH26 concentrations below the chemical and phototoxic limits (2 microM).},

title = {Analysing cell division in vivo and in vitro using flow cytometric measurement of CFSE dye dilution},
abstract = {Since its introduction in 1994 (J. Immunol. Methods 171 (1994) 131), the flow cytometric analysis of lymphocyte proliferation by serial halving of the fluorescence intensity of the vital dye CFSE (carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester or CFDA-SE) has become widely used in immunological laboratories around the world. This technique allows the visualisation of eight to 10 discrete cycles of cell division by flow cytometry, both in vitro and in vivo. Appropriately conjugated antibodies can be used to probe surface marker changes as cells divide, or changes in expression of internal molecules such as cytokines when appropriate fixation and permeabilisation protocols are used. An added advantage of the technique is the ability to recover viable cells which have undergone defined numbers of cell divisions by flow cytometric sorting, allowing functional studies to be performed. Other commonly used assays of cell proliferation give only limited information, as they usually measure division at a population level. The CFSE technique can be used to determine kinetics of immune responses, track proliferation in minor subsets of cells and follow the acquisition of differentiation markers or internal proteins linked to cell division.},

title = {Histone-GFP fusion protein enables sensitive analysis of chromosome dynamics in living mammalian cells},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The amplification of oncogenes in cancer cells is often mediated by paired acentric chromatin bodies called double minute chromosomes (DMs), which can accumulate to a high copy number because of their autonomous replication during the DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle and their subsequent uneven distribution to daughter cells during mitosis. The mechanisms that control DM segregation have been difficult to investigate, however, as the direct visualization of DMs in living cells has been precluded because they are far smaller than normal chromosomes. We have visualized DMs by developing a highly sensitive method for observing chromosome dynamics in living cells. RESULTS: The human histone H2B gene was fused to the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) of Aequorea victoria and transfected into human HeLa cells to generate a stable line constitutively expressing H2B-GFP. The H2B-GFP fusion protein was incorporated into nucleosomes without affecting cell cycle progression. Using confocal microscopy, H2B-GFP allowed high-resolution imaging of both mitotic chromosomes and interphase chromatin, and the latter revealed various chromatin condensation states in live cells. Using H2B-GFP, we could directly observe DMs in living cancer cells; DMs often clustered during anaphase, and could form chromosomal 'bridges' between segregating daughter chromosomes. Cytokinesis severed DM bridges, resulting in the uneven distribution of DMs to daughter cells. CONCLUSIONS: The H2B-GFP system allows the high-resolution imaging of chromosomes, including DMs, without compromising nuclear and chromosomal structures and has revealed the distinctive clustering behavior of DMs in mitotic cells which contributes to their asymmetric distribution to daughter cells.},

title = {An improved technique for calculating relative response in cellular proliferation experiments},
abstract = {Investigating the response of cells to specific agonists may involve the use of cell tracking dyes to assess the extent of stimulated proliferation, frequently reported as the proliferation index (PI). Calculation of PI uses a model for cell division that expects the cell number to double as cells proliferate through each successive generation. It is often useful to compare the PI of a stimulated control population with that of a population in the presence of some agent, whether chemical, pharmacologic, or cellular. For such comparison studies, the nature of the metric being used must be taken into account to accurately assess the extent of inhibition. Specifically, the metric used in ModFit LT (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME) and in FCS Express (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, CA) uses a metric with a lower limit of unity, whereas the metric used in FlowJo (Treestar, Ashland, OR) has a lower limit of zero. For studies involving cell proliferation comparisons using tracking dye dilution, a new equation is proposed as the appropriate calculation to use when determining the percent of relative response based on proliferation index values for a metric whose lower limit is unity.},

title = {Flow cytometry of the Side Population: tips {\&} tricks},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Side Population (SP) has become an important hallmark for the definition of the stem cell compartment, especially in the detection of these cells and in their physical isolation by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). SP cells are CD34neg and were discovered using ultraviolet excitation based on the efflux of Hoechst 33342 (Ho342). Although the method works as originally described, we believe that this method is difficult for most investigators. First, because the ability to discriminate SP cells is based on the differential retention of Ho342 during a functional assay; second, because of the difficulties in setting the right experimental and acquisition conditions; and third, because the analysis of the acquired data requires an extensive expertise on flow cytometry to accurately detect the SP events. METHODS: First of all and mainly for the SP application, the laser beam paths were exhaustively checked to ensure the lowest coefficients of variation. Blood suspensions were prepared by erythrocyte lysis with ammonium chloride and hematopoietic cells were labeled with Ho342. RESULTS: The Ho342 concentration and the staining procedure are critical for the optimal resolution of the SP cells. Although UV laser alignment is very important to resolve the dim tail that outlines the SP, the problem with Ho342 excitation is not the Hoechst Blue emission, but rather the Hoechst Red's (because of the weak emission). CONCLUSIONS: Each laboratory must establish its own expected ranges based on its instrument and results may vary slightly due to instrument differences such as the narrowness of the band pass filters, laser power, laser emission wavelength, nozzle type, differential of pressure, light collection system (cuvette versus jet-in-air) and beam shaping optics.},

title = {Side population in the pancreatic cancer cell lines SW1990 and CFPAC-1 is enriched with cancer stem-like cells},
abstract = {In this study, we first sought to determine the existence of side population (SP) cells in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we compared the biological characteristics of SP and non-SP cells. The presence of side population cells in pancreatic cancer cell lines was detected by Hoechst 33342 staining and FACS analysis. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using flow cytometry. SP and non-SP cells were exposed to various concentrations of gemcitabine; drug sensitivity was examined using the MTT assay and flow cytometry using Annexin-V and PI staining. To compare the tumorigenic ability in vivo, groups of nude mice were orthotopically inoculated with varying numbers of SP and non-SP cells. The percentages of CD44+CD24+ and CD133+ in SP and non-SP cells were also detected by FACS analysis. The SP fraction was detected in BxPc-3, CFPAC-1, MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1 and SW1990 pancreatic cancer cell lines. Cell cycle analysis revealed that the SP cells contained more cells in the G1 phase and fewer cells in the S phase when compared with the non-SP cells. The SP cells exhibited increased tumorigenetic ability following in vivo transplantation into BALB/C nude mice and increased chemoresistance following in vitro exposure to gemcitabine. FACS analysis showed that the SP cells contained more CD44+CD24+ and CD133+ cells than the non-SP cells. In conclusion, these observations suggest that SP cells in the pancreatic cancer cell lines possess the property of cancer stem cells. SP cells may therefore be novel specific targets for the effective treatment of pancreatic cancer.},

title = {Identification of a small subpopulation of candidate leukemia-initiating cells in the side population of patients with acute myeloid leukemia},
abstract = {In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), apart from the CD34(+)CD38(-) compartment, the side population (SP) compartment contains leukemic stem cells (LSCs). We have previously shown that CD34(+)CD38(-) LSCs can be identified using stem cell-associated cell surface markers, including C-type lectin-like molecule-1 (CLL-1), and lineage markers, such as CD7, CD19, and CD56. A similar study was performed for AML SP to further characterize the SP cells with the aim of narrowing down the putatively very low stem cell fraction. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of 48 bone marrow and peripheral blood samples at diagnosis showed SP cells in 41 of 48 cases that were partly or completely positive for the markers, including CD123. SP cells in normal bone marrow (NBM) were completely negative for markers, except CD123. Further analysis revealed that the SP fraction contains different subpopulations: (a) three small lymphoid subpopulations (with T-, B-, or natural killer-cell markers); (b) a differentiated myeloid population with high forward scatter (FSC(high)) and high sideward scatter (SSC(high)), high CD38 expression, and usually with aberrant marker expression; (c) a more primitive FSC(low)/SSC(low), CD38(low), marker-negative myeloid fraction; and (d) a more primitive FSC(low)/SSC(low), CD38(low), marker-positive myeloid fraction. NBM contained the first three populations, although the aberrant markers were absent in the second population. Suspension culture assay showed that FSC(low)/SSC(low) SP cells were highly enriched for primitive cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses showed that cytogenetically abnormal colonies originated from sorted marker positive cells, whereas the cytogenetically normal colonies originated from sorted marker-negative cells. In conclusion, AML SP cells could be discriminated from normal SP cells at diagnosis on the basis of expression of CLL-1 and lineage markers. This reveals the presence of a low-frequency (median, 0.0016%) SP subfraction as a likely candidate to be enriched for leukemia stem cells.},

title = {Genetic models to study quiescent stem cells and their niches},
abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have been defined by their ability to establish long-term hematopoiesis in myelo-ablated hosts. Prospective isolation using combinations of cell-surface markers and/or dye exclusion can yield highly purified and nearly homogeneous phenotypically defined cells that repopulate irradiated hosts. Although highly informative, these types of analyses may not necessarily reflect ongoing homeostatic hematopoiesis. HSCs are also described as being quiescent. This has been demonstrated by cell cycle analysis of phenotypically defined HSCs. Some studies have challenged the existence of truly quiescent HSCs, suggesting that they continuously cycle, albeit with very slow kinetics. Here we present a pulse-chase system based on the controllable incorporation of H2B-GFP into nucleosomes, which allows the identification, purification, and functional analysis of viable label-retaining cells. Our data complement and extend recent studies using similar strategies. These, together with our present studies, find a rare, quiescent or dormant subset within the population of stringently defined HSC phenotypes. To date, three types of niches, endosteal, vascular, and reticular, have been described; herein we review the cellular and spatial nature of these microenvironments. We propose that HSC label-retention combined with genetically manipulated stem cell niches will allow us to determine their anatomical architecture, to address HSC cell fate proliferation kinetics, and to begin to dissect the molecular cross talk among stem cells and niche cells in vivo during both normal and perturbed homeostasis.},

However, the cells are very rare in tissues and the available methods of isolating them are limited. The current study was performed to isolate BASCs in the murine lung using magnetic nanoparticle-based surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic dots (M-SERS Dots). We used K-ras(LA1) mice, a laboratory animal model of non-small cell lung cancer of human, and C57BL/6 mice having the same age as a control. We compared the BASCs between 2 species by FACS analysis with 4 markers of BASCs, CCSP, SP-C, CD34, and Sca-1. We found that BASCs were more abundant in the K-ras(LA1) mice than in the C57BL/6 mice. Also, the M-SERS Dot-mediated positive selection of the CD34(pos) cells enabled the BASCs to be enriched to an approximately 4- to 5-fold higher level than that in the case without pre-separation. In summary, our study demonstrates the potential of using M-SERS Dots as a sorting system with very effective isolation of BASCs and multiplex targeting probe, showing that they may play an effective role in the study of BASCs in the future.},

title = {Analysis of histone 2B-GFP retention reveals slowly cycling hematopoietic stem cells},
abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are thought to divide infrequently based on their resistance to cytotoxic injury targeted at rapidly cycling cells and have been presumed to retain labels such as the thymidine analog 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). However, BrdU retention is neither a sensitive nor specific marker for HSCs. Here we show that transient, transgenic expression of a histone 2B (H2B)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein in mice has several advantages for label-retention studies over BrdU, including rapid induction of H2B-GFP in virtually all HSCs, higher labeling intensity and the ability to prospectively study label-retaining cells, which together permit a more precise analysis of division history. Mathematical modeling of H2B-GFP dilution in HSCs, identified with a stringent marker combination (L(-)K(+)S(+)CD48(-)CD150(+)), revealed unexpected heterogeneity in their proliferation rates and showed that approximately 20% of HSCs divide at an extremely low rate (< or =0.8-1.8% per day).},

This model is based largely on in vivo invertebrate or in vitro mammal studies. Here, we examine the dynamic behavior of adult hair follicle stem cells in their normal setting by employing mice with repressible H2B-GFP expression to track cell divisions and Cre-inducible mice to perform long-term single-cell lineage tracing. We provide direct evidence for the infrequent stem cell division model in intact tissue. Moreover, we find that differentiation of progenitor cells occurs at different times and tissue locations than self-renewal of stem cells. Distinct fates of differentiation or self-renewal are assigned to individual cells in a temporal-spatial manner. We propose that large clusters of tissue stem cells behave as populations whose maintenance involves unidirectional daughter-cell-fate decisions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent development of semiautomated techniques for staining and analyzing flow cytometry samples has presented new challenges. Quality control and quality assessment are critical when developing new high throughput technologies and their associated information services. Our experience suggests that significant bottlenecks remain in the development of high throughput flow cytometry methods for data analysis and display. Especially, data quality control and quality assessment are crucial steps in processing and analyzing high throughput flow cytometry data. METHODS: We propose a variety of graphical exploratory data analytic tools for exploring ungated flow cytometry data. We have implemented a number of specialized functions and methods in the Bioconductor package rflowcyt. We demonstrate the use of these approaches by investigating two independent sets of high throughput flow cytometry data. RESULTS: We found that graphical representations can reveal substantial nonbiological differences in samples. Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function and summary scatterplots were especially useful in the rapid identification of problems not identified by manual review. CONCLUSIONS: Graphical exploratory data analytic tools are quick and useful means of assessing data quality. We propose that the described visualizations should be used as quality assessment tools and where possible, be used for quality control.},

title = {Reconstruction of cell population dynamics using CFSE},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantifying cell division and death is central to many studies in the biological sciences. The fluorescent dye CFSE allows the tracking of cell division in vitro and in vivo and provides a rich source of information with which to test models of cell kinetics. Cell division and death have a stochastic component at the single-cell level, and the probabilities of these occurring in any given time interval may also undergo systematic variation at a population level. This gives rise to heterogeneity in proliferating cell populations. Branching processes provide a natural means of describing this behaviour. RESULTS: We present a likelihood-based method for estimating the parameters of branching process models of cell kinetics using CFSE-labeling experiments, and demonstrate its validity using synthetic and experimental datasets. Performing inference and model comparison with real CFSE data presents some statistical problems and we suggest methods of dealing with them. CONCLUSION: The approach we describe here can be used to recover the (potentially variable) division and death rates of any cell population for which division tracking information is available.},
